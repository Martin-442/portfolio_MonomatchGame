I choose to have cards showing 8 numbers each - which makes a total number of 57 different cards. \

The game: \
Start the game and you'll see 2 cards on the screen. \
Try to find the only element that is present on both of the cards. \
The background of the number turns orange if you have clicked on the correct element. \
Click »New card set« for a new set of cards. 

Hint: With every reload of the page you'll get either a set of numbers or icons that are either upright or rotate randomly. 

Enjoy :)
