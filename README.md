online game adaptation of the "Dobble" board game. 

Inspired by: 
"How does Dobble (Spot It) work?" (Stand-up Maths)

and 
"How to make the card game Dobble (and the Maths behind it!)" (MirKat Maths)

The Fano plane algorithm by Micky Dore:

I choose to have cards showing 8 numbers each for a total number of 57 cards. 
The amount of numbers on one card can be ajusted in styles/main.js .


The game: 
There are 2 cards on the screen. 
Try to find the only number that is present on both of the cards. 
The background of the number turns green if you have clicked on the correct number. 

Reload the page for a new set of cards. 

Enjoy :)
